# Mixed Messaged Codecademy Project

This project was completed as part of the Codecademy back-end engineering course. It is used as a learning experience to put into practice the things learned with a project.

Mixed Messages is an interactive web page that allows people to get a motivational quote (from one of four categories), as well as opt for a 'motivational boost'.

The project involved the use of Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
